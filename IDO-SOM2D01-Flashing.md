# Flashing IDO-SOM2D01

This tutorial will explain what you need to do on empty or already flashed module to get latest Linux kernel up and runing.

# EMPTY MODULE

If you have empty module when you connect it to UART you should get some weird output from it

or in some cases like this (depends what terminal/UART are you using)
```
Welcome to minicom 2.7.1

```

After this you can connect SigmaStar/MStar USB Debug Tool that looks like this
And you can buy it from AliExpress/TaoBao...
I have bought from makers of module WirelessTag
https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=631665290641

![USBFlashTool](images/SigmaStarDebugTool.png)

Tools and files needed for this tutorial can be downloaded from manufacturer documentation site

http://doc.industio.com/docs/ssd20x_manual/ssd20x_manual-1cradqrvf230l

When you open ISP Flash Tool 5.0.0.x you will get warning if tool is not inserted in USB on PC

![FlashTool](images/SigmaStarDebugTool-Error.png)

So I suggest opening tool after USB Debug Tool is plugged in
When you open ISP Flash Tool
![FlashToolOpened](images/SigmaStarDebugToolApp.png)

You will have status bar with I2C: (92, B2), USB 402Khz (or similar) at bottom what means all is ready

After that you can press `Connect` and status windows should change as below
![FlashTool](images/SigmaStarDebugToolApp-Connected.png)

## Flashing GCIS.bin
Next we can choose 1st file to flash module and that is `GCIS.bin` that can be found in SpinandPackBinTool
![FlashTool](images/SigmaStarDebugToolApp-GCIS.png)

1) Select Image file (GCIS.bin/2kB) (I have moved mine to be inside ISP tool folder but you don't need to do that)
2) Make sure that `Erase Device` is checked and `All Chip` is selected under
3) `Base shift at` should be checked and left as `0x00000000`
4) If All is done press `Run` in top left corner under `Image`

After some time you will get green `PASS` and some logging under
```
Start time: 12:18:29
[W] 04000000 > 02000000
[W] 04000000 > 02000000
Program File Ready !!
Erase Message : Erasing ...
Erase OK.
Program Message : Programming ...
Verify Message : Verifying ...
Verify OK.
End time: 12:18:36
```
With this 1st stage is done so we can continue to next step

## Flashing IPL
1) Select IPL.bin (21.9kB) that can be found in SpinandPackBinTool also
2) Make sure that `Erase Device` is NOT checked 
3) `Base shift at` should be changed to: `0x140000`
4) Press `Run` and that should be it

![FlashTool](images/SigmaStarDebugToolApp-IPL.png)

## Flashing idosom2d01-ipl.bin
This is uBoot SPL that is called `idosom2d01-ipl` in outputs folder and need to add extension `.bin` so tool can burn it

1) Select idosom2d01-ipl.bin (40-50kB) that can be found in Github release section or build your own
2) Make sure that `Erase Device` is NOT checked 
3) `Base shift at` should be changed to: `0x200000`
4) Press `Run` and that should be it

## Next steps

Now you can disconnect and reboot your module that should boot into uBoot emergency loader from UART

## You need to send idosom2d01-u-boot.img via serial
I've using minicom on Linux with following steps (if can't run normally try with sudo minicom -s)
After Trying to boot from UART message in minicom pres `Ctrl+A` then press `s`
you will be prompted with popup where you need to select `ymodem` and then go all way top and press enter to get file dialog (here paste your file location will be easier then type all into) and press enter
After this you will get dialog with progress that will take maybe 1-2min

Warning: emac@2a2000 (eth0) using random MAC address - 02:93:96:a6:be:f9
eth0: emac@2a2000
=> 
```

Here you can use ethernet to load `kernel-rescue` but for me that didn't work I was getting timeout...
```
=> dhcp
emac@2a2000: PHY present at 0
PHY reset timed out
phy power up
emac@2a2000: Starting autonegotiation...
emac@2a2000: Autonegotiation timed out (status=0x78c9)
emac@2a2000: link down (status: 0x78c9)
=>
```

So I have to use serial and that took about 10min to load kernel-rescue via UART
```
setenv loadaddr 0x22000000; loady; bootm
```

After this step you should be able to use rescue image to complete flashing

**Note**

If UART log stop loading or it looks like it is frozen just type few times `Enter` key and you should be presented with login screen
```
Welcome to Buildroot                                                            
buildroot login: 
```

Enter `root` and we can start finishing flashing

This is set of commands you need to enter
```
ubiformat /dev/mtd1
ubiattach -m 1
ubimkvol /dev/ubi0 -N uboot -s 1MiB -t static
ubimkvol /dev/ubi0 -N env -s 256KiB
ubimkvol /dev/ubi0 -N kernel -s 16MiB
ubimkvol /dev/ubi0 -N rescue -s 16MiB
ubimkvol /dev/ubi0 -N rootfs -m
```
This should create 5 UBI partitions so we can work with them later

## Flashing `uBoot`
We need to transfer idosom2d01-u-boot.img via `rz` (receive zModem file) similar to `yModem` as we done it on before

For serial run rz and then send idosom2d01-u-boot.img
Check Note section down for `tftp` solution if you have network up and running
```
ubiupdatevol /dev/ubi0_0 idosom2d01-u-boot.img
```

## Flashing `kernel-rescue`
Transfer `idosom2d01-kernel-rescue.fit`
For serial run rz and then send idosom2d01-kernel-rescue.fit
```
ubiupdatevol /dev/ubi0_3 idosom2d01-kernel-rescue.fit
```

At this point your module should be able to boot into u-boot directly without needing serial and you should be able to boot back into the resuce setup by running:
```
setenv loadaddr 0x22000000; ubi readvol ${loadaddr} rescue 0x800000; bootm
```

## Flashing `kernel` and `rootfs` (ubifs)
Transfer files `idosom2d01-kernel.fit` and `idosom2d01-rootfs.ubifs`

If you have resterted board and booted into recovery you will need to run this before you can use `ubiupdatevol`
```
ubiattach -m 1
```

Now you can run remaining commands

```
ubiupdatevol /dev/ubi0_2 idosom2d01-kernel.fit
ubiupdatevol /dev/ubi0_4 idosom2d01-rootfs.ubifs
```

## Note
If you have working network you can transfer all files with `tfpt` so you can use this

`tftp -g -r kernel.fit 192.168.1.xxx -b 65464`

Change name and IP address to one where TFTP server is runnung and `-b 65464` can be removed but for me was increased transfer rate

## Finishing touches
Now as tou can boot to uBoot you need to setup some commands for uBoot to be able to boot directly to Linux without need serial or uBoot

```
setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 ubi.mtd=1 rootfstype=ubifs root=ubi0:rootfs rw clk_ignore_unused init=linuxrc
setenv bootcmd 'setenv loadaddr 0x22000000; ubi readvol ${loadaddr} kernel 0x800000; bootm ${loadaddr}'
saveenv
```

Now everything is flashed, you should be able to boot the normal kernel with a more feature rich rootfs.

Have fun!
